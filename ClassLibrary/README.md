# ðŸ“š Class Library Project

The **Class Library** is a shared project that contains common logic used across the entire solution. It includes:

- ðŸ§© **Interfaces** for all repositories
- ðŸ“¦ **Domain models** (e.g., `Department`, `User`)

This project helps keep the code modular, clean, and easy to maintain.
